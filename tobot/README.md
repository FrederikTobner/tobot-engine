# Tobot project

Contains a collection of libraries and tools for building a game engine.
The tobot-core library contains the core functionality of the engine.
The other libraries can be used to implement another game engine instead of the tobot-core library that we use.
This setup is inspired by LLVM (Tools for building a compiler) and Clang (The compiler of LLVM).
